     *  Finds tangent segments between two given circles.

     *  Returns an empty, or 2x4, or 4x4 array of doubles representing
     *  the two exterior and two interior tangent segments (in that order).
     *  If some tangents don't exist, they aren't present in the output.
     *  Each segment is represent by a 4-tuple x1,y1,x2,y2.
     * 
     *  Exterior tangents exist iff one of the circles doesn't contain
     *  the other. Interior tangents exist iff circles don't intersect.
     *
     *  In the limiting case when circles touch from outside/inside, there are
     *  no interior/exterior tangents, respectively, but just one common
     *  tangent line (which isn't returned at all, or returned as two very
     *  close or equal points by this code, depending on roundoff -- sorry!)
