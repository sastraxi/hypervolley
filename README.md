# hypervolley

Two-player local competitive tennis game.

Stuff I remember about the project:

1. It's built in Java using libgdx
2. It makes extensive use of preallocated arrays to avoid invoking the garbage collector
3. It has custom pixel shaders which override the built-in libgdx system. Blur, percentage-closer (I think?) shadows, gamma correction
4. It has a rudimentary AI so you can play single-player
5. It has sound effects
6. It has a menu
